# Prompts & Human Decisions Log

How this repo was built with Google Antigravity: milestone prompts, what the agent produced, and what the human decided.

## Milestone Entries

### Entry #0a
- **Date:** 2026-10-13
- **Goal:** Set up the U2U (Uyir2Uyir) monorepo with `backend/`, `docs/`, and `infra/` folders, the agent rules file, README skeleton, licensing, environment template, and initial git commit pushed to GitHub.
- **Prompt Summary:**
  Initialize `.gitignore` with ignore patterns. Scaffold `backend/` package directories (`core`, `auth`, `requests`, `rules`, `matching`, `outreach`, `screening`, `desk`, `ai`, `clock`), `backend/prompts/`, `backend/tests/`, `backend/eval/`, `docs/images/`, and `infra/`. Create root `AGENTS.md` and copy to `.agents/rules/u2u.md`. Draft `README.md` aligned with `U2U_BRIEF.md`. Create `docs/PROMPTS.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT, 2026 U2U team), and `.env.example`. Prepare and verify clean git staging before committing and pushing.

## Human Decisions

- **Hospital-first requests:** Only registered hospitals can initiate blood requests. Public message submissions at the Request Desk can at most send a one-tap "Raise this request?" alert to a registered hospital blood bank; public text never directly triggers donor calls.
- **The counting rule $N+1$:** Outreach pauses as soon as covered ($\text{accepted} + \text{onTheWay}$) reaches $N + 1$ (providing one spare donor). Outreach reopens if covered falls below $N$. The request is fulfilled when accepted reaches $N$, standing down any donors still en route.
- **Staff-only acceptance:** Blood centre staff make all medical eligibility, acceptance, and deferral decisions upon donor arrival. The application and AI models never make automated clinical clearance or acceptance decisions.
- **No fuzzy hospital matching:** Gemini extracts hospital names and fields with exact verbatim quotes from forwarded message text. Code matches strictly against a predetermined catalog or marks the message as `NOT_VERIFIED`. No fuzzy heuristics or hallucinated hospital matching are permitted.
- **Simulated data labelling:** In demo mode, all donors, hospitals, and patients are explicitly labelled as simulated. An orange `SIMULATED DATA` banner is prominently displayed across all application screens.
